# Visualizations

This folder contains visualizations used for analyzing and presenting the performance of the fraud detection model. The following visualizations are included:

## 1. Confusion Matrix

**File**: `confusion_matrix.png`

**Description**: 
The confusion matrix provides a summary of the classification results of the model. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This matrix helps in evaluating the performance of the model in distinguishing between legitimate transactions (Class 0) and fraudulent transactions (Class 1).

- **True Positives (TP)**: Number of fraudulent transactions correctly identified as fraud.
- **True Negatives (TN)**: Number of legitimate transactions correctly identified as legitimate.
- **False Positives (FP)**: Number of legitimate transactions incorrectly identified as fraud.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Number of fraudulent transactions incorrectly identified as legitimate.

## 2. Heatmap

**File**: `heatmap.png`

**Description**:
The heatmap visualization is a graphical representation of data where individual values are represented by colors. It provides an intuitive way to understand the distribution and intensity of values across the confusion matrix.

## 3. Pie Chart of Legitimate vs Fraud Transactions

**File**: `pie_chart.png`

**Description**:
The pie chart visualizes the proportion of legitimate vs. fraudulent transactions. It shows how the total number of transactions is divided between these two categories, giving a clear overview of the dataset composition.
